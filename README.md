# airbnb-rating-analysis

Have ever stayed or booked an Airbnb? If yes, you probably have looked at the reveiws and ratings of properties before making your decision. Reviews and ratings of properties play a huge role in hospitality industry. A good place with high ratings attract clients, where as a bad rating warns or repels them, given that the review information is accurate and unbiased. Specially, the owners of propeties strive to deliver the best service and comfort possible for thier client and expects a nice review and ratings in return. Keeping the importance of airbnb rating in mind, I decided to make a prediction model that considers different components (price, location, reaction of property owner, etc) and quantifies their impact on the review ratings. This is helpful for owners becasue, based on the results of prediction model, they can reflect back on their service and work on the weak areas to boost their reveiw ratings.
