# Airbnb Rating Analysis

Have ever stayed or booked an Airbnb? If yes, you probably have looked at the reveiws and ratings of properties before making your decision. Reviews and ratings of properties play a huge role in hospitality industry. A good place with high ratings attract clients, where as a bad rating warns or repels them, given that the review informations are accurate and unbiased. The owners of propeties strive to deliver the best service and comfort possible for thier client and expects a nice review and ratings in return. 

Keeping the importance of airbnb rating in mind, I decided to make a prediction model that considers different components (price, location, reaction of property owner, etc) and quantifies their impact on the review ratings. Similarly, I also studied what determines the number of reviews. These are particularly helpful for Airbnb property owners becasue, based on the results of prediction models, they could evaluate thier strength and weakness and work towards earning a good reveiw ratings and reputations for their business.  

In this project we plan to accomplish two main goals:
 1) Build a prediction (multilevel) model for predicting the quality of ratings
 2) Study what determines the number of reveiws (poisson distribution)
